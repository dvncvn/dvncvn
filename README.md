# Simon Duncan

Staff product designer focused on complex systems and developer tools.

I work on turning technically powerful platforms into experiences that feel clear, intentional, and calm under pressure. Strong bias toward solid mental models, opinionated defaults, and shipping real things.

Currently designing data and AI platform experiences.

Outside of work I make music and mess with sound, texture, and generative ideas.
